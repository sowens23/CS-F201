# Lab 03

## Instructions

* Complete as many of the following tasks as you can. You must successfully complete at least _**the first**_ of these tasks to receive credit for this lab.
* Regularly check in your changes using `git add`, `git commit -m "Your meaningful message goes here"`, and `git push`. In order to receive full credit in the homework assignments, you must regularly check in your changes. The first commit for every `.cpp` file should be a minimal C++ program that contains only `int main() 
{ 
   return 0;    
}`
* When you complete a task, change the empty checkbox `- [ ]` for that task to a completed checkbox `- [x]`

- [X] fizz.cpp
- [X] fizzbuzz.cpp 


## Required

### fizz.cpp

* Write a program called `fizz.cpp`:
  - Write a C++ program that has a for-loop going through the numbers 1 to 100.
  - For each number divisible by 3, the program prints `Fizz`
  - For other numbers—not divisible by 3—the number itself is printed.
  
  ```$ ./fizz
  1
  2
  Fizz
  4
  5
  Fizz
  …

```
  


## Recommended

### fizzbuzz.cpp

* Write a program called `fizzbuzz.cpp`:
  - Write a C++ program that has a for-loop going through the numbers 1 to 100.
  - For each number divisible by 3, the program prints `Fizz`
  - For each number divisible by 5, the program prints `Buzz`
  - If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, then the program prints `FizzBuzz`
  - For other numbers— divisible by neither 3 nor 5—the number itself is printed.

```$ ./fizz
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
…
14
FizzBuzz
16
