# Lab

## Instructions

* **This lab is due before class on Fri 7 October 2022**
* Regularly check in your changes using `git add`, `git commit -m "Your meaningful message goes here"`, and `git push`. In order to receive full credit, you must regularly check in your changes. The first commit for every `.cpp` file should be a minimal C++ program that contains only `int main() 
{ 
   return 0;    
}`
* When you complete a task, change the empty checkbox `- [ ]` for that task to a completed checkbox `- [x]`
