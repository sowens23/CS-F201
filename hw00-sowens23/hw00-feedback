Hi Spencer,

HW00 is a credit - no credit assignment and you got the full credit! 
Just one small thing here:
In the cpp file, I saw you're using many libraries, here for a simple
Hello World output, we could just use one library #include <iostream>,
or the customed header file std_lib_facilities.h that you have in the
repo because it contains #include <iostream> too.

Excellent!
