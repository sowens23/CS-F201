# Lab - Part A (13%)

Part A of [this lab](../README.md) provides you with an opportunity to write questions that assess satisfactory understanding of the contents from [Chapters 2-6 of Programming Principles and Practice using C++][textbook].

### What you should do

Your task is to write a C++ program in a file called `part_a.cpp` in the `part_a` subdirectory of your  repository. When your code is compiled and run, the resulting program should:
* Print a completed game of [Tic-Tac-Toe board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe).
  - Extend the version from Part B so that dividers are printed between columns and between rows.


### What the results should look like

A successful run of the program should look like this:
<pre>$ ./part_a
x|x|x
- - -
x|o|o
- - -
o| | 
</pre>

### Minimum criteria required for code to be graded

To earn any credit for Part A, the following criteria must be met:
* Your code must be correctly pushed to the **main** branch of this Github repository
* You must have a file called `part_a.cpp` located in the `part_a` subdirectory (not in the root of this git repository)
* The file `part_a.cpp` must cleanly compile on `aurora` with no errors or warnings with the command: `g++ -std=c++17 -o part_a part_a.cpp`


If either of these criteria are not met, your code will not be graded and you will receive zero credit for Part A.
