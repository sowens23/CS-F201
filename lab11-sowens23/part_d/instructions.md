# Lab - Part D (61%)

Part D of [this lab](../README.md) provides you with an opportunity to write questions that assess basic understanding of the contents from [Chapters 2-6 of Programming Principles and Practice using C++][textbook].

### What you should do

Your task is to write a C++ program in a file called `part_d.cpp` in the `part_d` subdirectory of your  repository. When your code is compiled and run, the resulting program should:
* Print a representation of a blank [Tic-Tac-Toe board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe), where each blank square is represented by a `'_'` character. You must use a `for` loop where you keep track of the `row` (0, 1, or 2) and a nested `for` loop where you keep track of the `column` (0, 1, 2).


### What the results should look like

A successful run of the program should look like this:
<pre>$ ./part_d
___
___
___
</pre>

### Minimum criteria required for code to be graded

To earn any credit for Part D, the following criteria must be met:
* Your code must be correctly pushed to the **main** branch of this Github repository
* You must have a file called `part_d.cpp` located in the `part_d` subdirectory (not in the root of this git repository)
* The file `part_d.cpp` must cleanly compile on `aurora` with no errors or warnings with the command: `g++ -std=c++17 -o part_d part_d.cpp`


If either of these criteria are not met, your code will not be graded and you will receive zero credit for Part D.
