# Lab - Part B (13%)

Part B of [this lab](../README.md) provides you with an opportunity to practice understanding of the contents from [Chapters 2-6 of Programming Principles and Practice using C++][textbook].

### What you should do

Your task is to write a C++ program in a file called `part_b.cpp` in the `part_b` subdirectory of your HW02 repository. When your code is compiled and run, the resulting program should:
* Write a program that prints out the lyrics to 99 bottles of beer on the wall


### What the results should look like

A successful run of the program should look like this:
<pre>$ ./part_b
99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer. Take one down, pass it around, 99 bottles of beer on the wall
98 bottles of beer on the wall, 98 bottles of beer. Take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall
97 bottles of beer on the wall, 97 bottles of beer. Take one down, pass it around, 97 bottles of beer on the wall
</pre>

In this example run, the user's input is shown in **bold**.
Your prompts should exactly match those shown above, and the format of your response to the user should exactly match that shown above.


### Minimum criteria required for code to be graded

To earn any credit for Part B, the following criteria must be met:
* Your code must be correctly pushed to the **main** branch of this Github repository
* You must have a file called `part_b.cpp` located in the `part_b` subdirectory (not in the root of this git repository)
* The file `part_b.cpp` must cleanly compile on `aurora` with no errors or warnings with the command: `g++ -std=c++17 -o part_b part_b.cpp`


If either of these criteria are not met, your code will not be graded and you will receive zero credit for Part B.
