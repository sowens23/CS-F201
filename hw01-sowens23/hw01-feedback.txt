Hi Spencer,

Your total score for HW01 is 97/100. 
The partial scores and feedbacks for each part are within the cpp file in each part. 
If you have any questions regarding scores or solutions, feel free to contact either Dr. Schwartz or Yali.
Also, late policy will be applied since lab04 and hw02.
Be careful that late commits / submissions will be deducted 10% per day after the due date.

Thanks,
Yali
