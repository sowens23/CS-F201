# HW03 - Part B (13%)

Part B of [this assignment](../README.md) provides you with an opportunity to demonstrate a high understanding of the contents from [Chapters 2-6 of Programming Principles and Practice using C++][textbook].


## What you should do

For each part question, write a file corresponding to that name and implement the instructions. For example, for question D-01, write a file called d01.cpp


## B-17

Write a complete C++ program. Create a function that can be called as follows: `name("John", "Q", "Jackson")` that returns the string `"Jackson, John Q."` for those parameters. Write a main function that calls the function with the above parameters. Initialize a called `n` with the results of the function call. Finally, print the value of the string `n`.

## B-18

Write a complete C++ program. Create a function called `string op_name(char op)`. If the parameter `op` is `'+'`, `'-'`, `'/'`, or `'*'`, return the string corresponding to the name of that arithmetic operator (`"addition"`, `"substraction"`, `"division"`, or `"multiplication"`), or `"unknown"` if the parameter `op` had any other value.


## B-19

Write a complete C++ program. Create a function called `int smallest(vector<int> numbers)` that returns the smallest number in the vector.


## B-20

Write a complete C++ program in which all of the following errors are fixed:

```
include iostrem;

main() {

  if 100 < 10 {
    cout "100 is less than 10";

  return 0
}

```
