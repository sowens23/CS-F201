# HW03 - Part C (13%)

Part C of [this assignment](../README.md) provides you with an opportunity to demonstrate basic understanding of the contents from [Chapters 2-6 of Programming Principles and Practice using C++][textbook].

## What you should do

For each part question, write a file corresponding to that name and implement the instructions. For example, for question D-01, write a file called d01.cpp


## C-13

Write a complete C++ program. The program should initialize a `double` variable, and then safely convert it to an `int` variable. Print both values, along with an explanation of how they are different and why they are different.


## C-14

Write a complete C++ program. Initialize a `vector<string> words` variable containing six elements. Print out element `words[0]`. Print an explanation of why that particular string is printed. Print out element `words[4]`. Print an explanation of why that particular string is printed. 

## C-15 

Write a complete C++ program. Initialize a `vector<string> words` variable containing six elements. Use a for-each loop to print the value of each string.

## C-16

Write a complete C++ program. Initialize a `vector<double> numbers` variable.  Use a `while` to read one double at a time from the user until there is no more user input. Each double should be stored in the vector `numbers`. After the `while` loop, use a for-each loop to print each number on its own line.
