# HW03 - Part D (61%)

Part D of [this assignment](../README.md) provides you with an opportunity to demonstrate basic understanding of the contents from [Chapters 2-6 of Programming Principles and Practice using C++][textbook].

## What you should do

For each part question, write a file corresponding to that name and implement the instructions. For example, for question D-01, write a file called d01.cpp


## D-01

Write the minimal C++ program. The code should successfully compile and run with no errors and no warnings.


## D-02

Write the minimal `Hello world` program in C++. When run, the code should simply print out the message `Hello world` followed by a newline.

## D-03

Write a complete C++ program that prompts the user for their first name and then reads the user input into a string, and then prints a message confirming the user's first name.


## D-04

Write a complete C++ program. The program should print instructions that print out the complete command line used to compile a program using g++, along with a detailed explanation of what each part of the command line means.

## D-05

Write a complete C++ program. The program should print ten examples of literal values in C++, and for each literal value you should state what its type is.

## D-06

Write a complete C++ program. The program should print out the C++ literal types that we are using in this course, along with a description of what type of data each type stores, and a 2-3 sentence description of when it should be used.

## D-07

Write a complete C++ program. The program should list the steps that are part of the process of taking a C++ file and creating the corresponding executable file.

## D-08

Write a complete C++ program. The program should create 10 `int` variables. Two should be initialized using `+`, two using `-`, two using `*`, two using `/`, two using `%`, and five using more than one of these operators. For each variable, print out the result and an explanation (at least one full sentence) of why the result is what it is.

## D-09

Write a complete C++ program. The program should include a `for` loop that runs exactly 6 times, printing out the value of the for loop variable as it runs.

## D-10

Write a complete C++ program.  You must implement a function called `string big_or_small(int x)` that returns `"big"` if `x` is greater than `50`, `"small"` if `x` is less than `10`, and `"neither"` otherwise.

## D-11

Write a complete C++ program. Come up with an example of a small function. Your program must first print that function. The program should then print an explanation of each of the four parts of a function. Include what each part is called, and include an example.

## D-12

Write a complete C++ program. Print a description of what C++ types may be used in a `switch` statement.


## What does it mean if I successfully complete this part of the assignment?

Part D of this assignment is designed to assess basic understanding of the content from [Chapter 4 of Programming Principles and Practice using C++][textbook].

The term **basic understanding** is used in the description of the [UAF grading system](https://catalog.uaf.edu/academics-regulations/grading-system-gpa-computation).

Successful completion of Part D indicates successful demonstration of the skills listed in [the grading rubric for Part D](rubric.tsv).
