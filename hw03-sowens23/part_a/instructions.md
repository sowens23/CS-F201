# HW03 - Part A (13%)

Part A of [this assignment](../README.md) provides you with an opportunity to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the contents from [Chapters 2-6 of Programming Principles and Practice using C++][textbook].


## What you should do

For each part question, write a file corresponding to that name and implement the instructions. For example, for question D-01, write a file called d01.cpp


## A-21

Write a complete C++ program. Use a `while` loop and `cin` to read `double` values from the user, storing the results in a `vector<double>`. Use a `for` loop to print the results. Then use a for-each loop to print the results. Print an explanation of the difference between these two techniques, and a description of when it is a good idea to use one versus the other.

## A-22

Write a complete C++ program. Create a function called `string cat(vector<string> words)`. Your function should use a `for` loop and string concatenation to return the words separated by spaces. Run the function multiple times in main with various vectors of words. At least one of your vectors must be only strings that look like integers ("1", "-15", etc).


## A-23

Write a complete C++ program that includes nested `for` loops. Prior to the loops, initialize an integer variable that is set to zero initially. Inside the innermost loop, increment the integer. At the end, print out the value of the variable and a detailed explanation of why it has the value that it has.

## A-24

Write a complete C++ program. Initialize a vector of strings called words. Write a for loop in which you print the values of the vector in reverse order.
