Hi Spencer, 

Lab02 is a credit - no credit assignment and you got the full credit! 
Just one thing in your date.cpp: in your output, the order of MM and DD
seems to be reversed.
Also, using namespace std is not recommended because it might cause the
issue of namespace pollution.

Excellent!
